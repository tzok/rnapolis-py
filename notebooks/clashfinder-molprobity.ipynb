    "In the standard run, clashfinder detected **48** clashes, which means that only the most obvious and strongest steric overlaps were reported. The program checks pairs of nearby atoms and marks a clash only when the distance between them is smaller than the sum of their van der Waals radii. This gives a simple overview of major geometric problems in the structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "After enabling `--enable-molprobity-mode`, the number of detected clashes increased to **1767**. This happens because an extra margin of 0.5 Å is added to the distance cutoff, so even weaker and borderline overlaps are counted as clashes. In this mode clashfinder becomes much more sensitive and starts to report many small geometric inconsistencies that are ignored in the standard run. Since `--ignore-occupancy` is used in both cases, all clashes are reported only based on geometry, without considering atom occupancy values.\n"
